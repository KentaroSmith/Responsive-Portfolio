        <p>Learning to code was a hobby for me at first, but after a few online classes, my hobby began picking
            up momentum and I try to find ways to incorporate it in to my day to day work! I enrolled in KU's coding
            bootcamp as a way to challenge myself, with ambitions to become a full-stack developer!
            <br>
            At the moment, my coursework focuses on learning the basics of web development, including HTML, CSS, and
            Java Script.
            Within the next 6 months I will be working on projects that make use of SQL and other backend tools. I am
            also
            trying to fit in side projects that use Python and Java on my own.
